## üì£ Latest Updates
- **Sep 7-2025**: Partial Code Release. Working to update remaining parts of the code.


## üî• Highlights
- **Mammo-SAE**:  First SAE trained on Mammogram Vision-Language Foundation Model to interpret breast concepts such as mass, calcification.

### Installation

-  To install all required dependencies, run:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirments.txt
    ```


---

### Checkpoints

- **Sparse Autoencoder (SAE):** Pretrained SAE checkpoints are included with this repository.  

    ```sh

    # minimal example to download the MammoSAE
    ckpt_path = hf_hub_download(
        repo_id=f"KKNakka/MammoSAE",
        filename=f"sparse_autoencoder_final.pt",
        repo_type="model"
    )

    print(f"Loading SAE checkpoint from: {ckpt_path}")
    state_dict = torch.load(ckpt_path)
    autoencoder.load_state_dict(state_dict)

    ```

- **MammoCLIP:** Download the pretrained MammoCLIP checkpoints from Hugging Face and place them in the `Mammo_CLIP_weights/` directory.  

---


### SAE Performance


-  We reconstruct the local features at the last layer of the Mammo-CLIP backbone with SAE using

    ```sh
    bash scripts/eval_with_sae_reconstruction.sh
    ```


### Launch Intervention

- We provide scripts to reproduce Figure 2 using the commands below. 

#### Intervention: Top-k Latent Neurons Activated

- To launch an intervention that activates only the `top-k` neurons, run:

    ```sh
    bash scripts/topk_activate_latent_neuron_intervention.sh
    ```


#### Intervention: Top-k Latent Neurons Deactivated

- To launch an intervention that deactivates only the top-k neurons, run:
    ```sh

    bash scripts/topk_deactivate_latent_neuron_interventions.sh

    ```

### Visualization of Latent Neurons

- To visualize the top-k latent neurons, please run:

    ```sh
    bashs scripts/visualizations.sh
    ```
